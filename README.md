# Web-Crawler-Sentiment-Analysis
The main goal of the project was to create a specialized web crawler capable of efficiently collecting URLs from diverse online sources. Additionally, the project focused on developing a user-friendly interface that would allow users to engage with the sentiment analysis outcomes. Users were provided with the ability to upload CSV or XLSX files containing text data, and then obtain sentiment scores and predicted results for each text entry. Finally, users were able to conveniently

The project utilizes web crawling, sentiment analysis, and a user-friendly interface to achieve this objective.

The web crawling process played a pivotal role in achieving the project's objective, demonstrating its effectiveness in collecting a substantial number of URLs. By targeting specific online sources, the technique ensured that the gathered data was relevant and representative of the desired subject matter.

This efficient data collection phase serves as a foundation for the subsequent sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis, a sub-field of natural language processing, was employed to determine the prevailing sentiment expressed within the collected content. By applying sentiment analysis algorithms to each piece of data, sentiment scores were generated, providing insights into the intensity and polarity of the sentiments expressed.

To enhance usability and enable effective exploration of the sentiment analysis results, a user interface was developed. This intuitive platform allowed users to upload text data files for sentiment analysis and obtain sentiment scores and predicted results for each entry.

The user interface also provided options to filter and categorize the sentiment analysis results based on various criteria, enabling users to gain deeper insights into the data. 

Features:
1)Web Crawling: The project utilizes web crawling techniques to collect a substantial number of URLs from specific online sources.
